# LLM Evaluation Tool for Google Sheets

Welcome to the official homepage for the LLM Evaluation Tool. This tool is a Google Apps Script designed to streamline the process of evaluating and comparing the output of various Large Language Models directly within a Google Sheet.

## What It Does

The LLM Evaluation Tool allows researchers and developers to systematically test prompts against different models, log results, and ensure consistency in evaluation, all without leaving their spreadsheet environment.

## Key Features

* **Tiered Model Evaluation:** Run prompts against different tiers of models, with prerequisite checks to ensure cost-effective and logical evaluation flows.
* **Dual Logging System:** Automatically logs all user edits to tracked columns and every API evaluation call for complete auditability.
* **Admin Controls:** A protected admin panel allows for secure configuration of API endpoints, model tiers, and user permissions.
* **Custom Functions:** Includes powerful custom sheet functions like `=PARSE()` and `=RENDER_LATEX()` to extend the tool's capabilities.
